# DirectX11_Demo

Hello!
Thanks for having a look at my code.
If there are any issues with launching the project, make sure you have the **DirectX 11 Toolkit** installed (The gitignore from GitHub ignores packages). You can easily add this to the project if you are using Visual Studio by right clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and navigating to **Manage NuGet Packages...** , where you can browse 'DirectXTK' and download the appropriate one for your OS (I am using Windows 10 so mine is directxtk_desktop_win10).
